In this project we used the huffington post pollster api along with D#.js to create bar graphs of the Republican and Democratic primary polls. We then had to provide our own style for the poles and create a README file.

The visualization I created was to alter the color of the bars on the graph to reflect the party that each candidate belong to. Republican candidates have a red bar and Democrat candidates have blue bar.
