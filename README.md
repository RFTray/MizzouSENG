## 2016 Presidential Primary Polls

###rft5g9

In this project we used the huffington post pollster api along with D#.js to create bar graphs of the Republican and Democratic primary polls.  We then had to provide our own style for the poles and create a README file.

[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
[Huffing Post API](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api)

The visualization I created was to alter the color of the bars on the graph to reflect the party that each candidate belong to.  Republican candidates have a red bar and Democrat candidates have blue bar.
